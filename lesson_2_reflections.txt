Q) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A) When you initialize a repository a file directory called .git is created which stores meta date for git
to use. We need it so git can run on this directory. The files become trackable and we can begin a commit history.


Q) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?

A) The staging area is where files are added to become commited. The working directory is the directory 
that has files being worked on but are not ready to be commited. A repository is a directory of the files that have
been commited. The area adds a lot of value in planning which files to commit.

Q) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A) The staging area is used to go over what file changes have been made using diff. It used as a final checkpoint
before commiting to see only 1 logical change was made


Q) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

A) Branched are ueful when you want to introduce a new feature but want to keep a working copy of your project.
Branched help in copying the master and poroviding flexibility to explore and edit the program for that feature.
